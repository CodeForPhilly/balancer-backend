# TLDR

Much of the work of understanding complex commands to run docker containers has been automated into make commands.

- Two of these commands are currently necessary to build our project (build-base-image and build-project), but will eventually only be useful for image managers (once the images are in a centralized repo).

After building the project, the easiest way to get the backend and frontend up and running is to use `docker compose up` from the project root directory.

# Docker is hard, but we can pretend it isn't üòè

## Purpose

Eliminate barriers to deploying backend development environment, so you can focus on writing good code!

## A note on Makefiles

We employ a [Makefile](../Makefile) to abstract complex installation and deployment commands into simple one-liners.

### Why a Makefile?

#### It's easy to use

Make is a convenient way to abstract scripts of complex shell code into simple commands.

#### It's DRY

Pre-existing make commands can be declared as pre-requisites for other commands. For example,
a command `initialize-project` may require `pull-repo` and `build-project` as pre-requisite commands (which should themselves be smart about not repeating work that has already been done!)

#### Why not Python?

While one can make use of Python for command line scripting, ultimately that code must itself call shell code. If keyword arguments are not necessary (Python is much better at handling those across platforms in my opinion), I opt for Makefiles, which don't need to wrap each shell command to be executed.

## Show me the commands, already!

### You need Make to run the commands

#### Mac OS

Modern versions of Mac OS should come with make already installed. If you don't have the Make command already, after following the MAC_OS_INSTALLATION.md, open a terminal and run the following...
`brew install gcc`

#### Linux

Make should already be installed on your distribution. If not, you should be able to use your package manage to install it.

For example, on debian
`apt install make`.

#### Windows

You'll have the smoothest experience using [Windows Subsystem Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for development of this project. After following Microsoft's instructions and installing a Linux distro, navigate to a terminal within the distro,and then follow the instructions in the Linux section above.

### Command location

All make commands should be run from the backend dir:

```
$YOUR_GIT_REPO_LOCATION/backend
```

### Build commands

You need to build the project's docker container in order to use it.

#### Base Image

The backend development environment requires a "base image" combining Python and the Poetry dependency installation tool. Before doing anything else, ensure you have our base image by running
`make build-base-image`.

#### Build the Development image

After installating the base-image, run
`make build-project`
in order to build the balancer backend develompent environment.

### Deployment commands

The development image must be instantiated as a container before use. Think of the image as a class defining the development environment, and the container as an actual
instance of that class.

After building the development image, you can use
`make launch-local-project`
to launch an instance of the backend and shell into it.

Note: You may launch multiple instances of the backend at once in different terminals.

#### Change the launch command

By default, `make launch-local-project` results in a shell within the backend instance, due to the default value (/bin/bash) for the launch command variable (DOCKER_LOCAL_CMD). You can override this variable (`DOCKER_LOCAL_CMD=pytest .` or `DOCKER_LOCAL_CMD=make migrations`) for different behavior.

#### Tearing down lingering containers

All project-related containers can be torn down using `make teardown-project`.

#### Convience commands

##### Launching django server

We use Django for serving our API endpoints to the balancer frontend. In other words, Django's web-server must be running in order to use our app. To do so, in its own termainal, run

```
make launch-local-server
```

#### NOTE

The local server does not (by default) run as a background process, so you'll need to give it its own terminal to run in!

#### Launching shell-plus

[Shell plus](https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shell_plus.html) is an extremely convenient manner of working with Django (our models, ORM, api, etc). Some immediately useful functionality:

    - Automatically imports all models, such that they can be called without manual imports.
    - Adds tab auto-complete to all project paths, making it easier to use imports.
    - Gives direct access to the ORM (i.e., `Accounts.objects.filter(...)`)

#### API Calls

Pending ...

#### create-superuser

For swift generation of a user account (with username and password), Django comes with the [createsuperuser management command ](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial02/). For convenience, this can be quickly accessed using `make create-superuser`.

#### migrations

For convenient access to the [makemigrations command](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-makemigrations), `make migrations` is available.

#### migrate

For convenient access to the [migrate command](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-migrate).
